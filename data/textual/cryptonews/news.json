            "That means a more than 2.7% jump in the difficulty that individual miners face as they attempt to discover a Bitcoin block.",
            "The jump in mining difficulty reflects the fact that, as per CoinWarz.com, the average block time is currently around 9.73 minutes, 0.27 minutes (or around 16.2 seconds) faster than the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s aim of maintaining a block time of around 10 minutes.",

            "A surge in Bitcoin network fees this month has delivered a nice boost to Bitcoin mining profitability \u2013 miners not only get rewarded with newly issued BTC tokens when each block is mined, but they also get paid a share of network fees.",
            "Behind the fee surge, which has admittedly eased in recent weeks although fees still remain at abnormal levels, is an explosion of activity on the Bitcoin blockchain related to the Ordinals protocol.",
            "The Ordinals protocol, which pioneered the concept of inscriptions directly onto the Bitcoin base chain, has been touted as adding significant functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain.",

            "Bitcoin appears to be in the early stages of transitioning into a smart chain (like Ethereum), and demand for inscriptions, which are counted as transactions, has resulted in an increase in demand for Bitcoin network block space.",
            "The Ordinals protocol was only launched at the end of last year and the BRC-20 token standard only around two months ago.",
            "Indeed, it seems as though inscription innovation on the Bitcoin blockchain has only just got kicking.",
            "That means that, at the very least, transaction numbers will likely remain inflated beyond their pre-Bitcoin Ordinals protocol levels of last year for the foreseeable future.",
            "And that means that Bitcoin network fees are likely to remain elevated, which should mean the incentive for more miners to continue joining the network remains strong.",
            "The main uncertainty for miners right now (beyond the Bitcoin price\u2019s daily fluctuations) is next year\u2019s halving, which will see the block reward cut in half from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.",
            "That might act as a disincentive for new miners to get involved, out of fear that a halving of the reward may make the endeavor unprofitable.",
            "But historically, the Bitcoin price has performed exceptionally well in the lead-up to and period immediately after the halving, more than making up for the halving of the block reward."

            "Last Friday was a historic day for the Bitcoin network.",
            "For the first time in Bitcoin\u2019s history, the number of wallet addresses holding at least 1 BTC entire token surpassed one million.",
            "The consistent rise in the number of so-called \u201cwholecoiner\u201d Bitcoin wallets, which resumed in 2022 after pausing in 2020 and 2021, comes amid a continued rise in the number of wallets holding at least 0.1 and 0.01 BTC, as well as a continued increase in the number of wallets with a non-zero balance.",
            "Those wallet cohorts are now at 4.367 million, 12.032 million and 46.715 million respectively, all at or close to record highs.",
            "The more egalitarian distribution of the Bitcoin supply comes as new Bitcoins continue to be mined (at a current rate of around 6.25 per 10 minutes as each block is added to the chain) and distributed amongst the miners, with these coins then eventually finding their way onto the market.",
            "It also comes as Bitcoin\u2019s adoptions by society at large grows \u2013 as more and more people take and interest in Bitcoin and start investing, higher demand pushes the price up (in the long-run, anyway) and incentivises early Bitcoin investors/adopters with a large stash to start distributing their holdings.",
            "According to trends in the growth rate of the number of wholecoiner wallets in recent years, some might consider this cohort of wallets to represent so-called \u201csmart money\u201d.",
            "Smart money refers to investors who are highly educated and/or engaged in the market \u2013 which those who own 1 Bitcoin or more are likelier to be than say your average investor who just owns a few hundred bucks of BTC.",
            "During the parabolic bull run of late 2020 and the period of a high average Bitcoin price in 2021, growth in the number of wholecoiner wallets stalled and even went negative at times.",
            "That suggests wholecoiners were cashing in on the bull market and selling to the smaller cohorts, whose numbers generally kept rising throughout the bull market.",
            "The growth rate of the number of wholecoiners only really began picking up again from June 2022, when the Bitcoin price crashed back under $30,000, before leaping in November after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX triggered a rush amongst Bitcoin investors to take self-custody of their holdings.",
            "The continued push higher in the number of 1 BTC holding wallets might thus be taken as a sign that \u201csmart money\u201d continues to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d.",
            "Indeed, while the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has performed exceptionally well so far this year (BTC was last up around 65% year-to-date), at current levels in the low-$27,000s, it still remains around 60% down versus its 2021 record highs in the $69,000 area.",
            "While a Bitcoin bull market may well be back, it's still very much in its early stages.",
            "And when the growth rate of the number of wholecoiner wallets slows/reverses, that could be a sign that the bull market is maturing."

            "The BRC-20 standard, which was developed and deployed by a pseudonymous Twitter user by the name of Domo only just over one month ago, uses the Bitcoin-based Ordinals protocol and inscriptions to manage token contracts, token minting and token transfers.",
            "The Ordinals protocol, launched late last year, is an innovative numbering system for every Satoshi in existence (each BTC has 21 million Satoshis), while an \u201cinscription\u201d is when a layer of data is added on top of a Satoshi.",

            "According to a dashboard created by Dune to monitor the new standard and its growth, BRC-20 tokens accounted for over 60% of all transaction activity on the Bitcoin blockchain on Tuesday, whilst paying 42.8% of all fees.",
            "And the surge in BRC-20-related activity has gone hand-in-hand with a surge in overall Bitcoin transactions and an exponential surge in Bitcoin transaction fees.",

            "Higher transaction fees are clearly dampening the demand from new and existing Bitcoin network users, as would be expected.",
            "However, the surge in fees is a boon for Bitcoin miners.",
            "Miners typically rely upon the issuance of new Bitcoin (which currently occurs at a rate of 6.25 BTC per block \u2013 which is roughly every 10 minutes) to fund their activities.",
            "Transaction fees typically make up a very small portion of miner income.",
            "But the Bitcoin Fee Ratio Multiple (which equals Bitcoin miner income coming from new BTC issuance divided by Bitcoin miner income coming from transaction fees) has been falling sharpy in recent days.",
            "As of Monday, it was around 2.34, down from a mid-April high of above 68.",
            "A stronger miner network arguably means a more secure, robust Bitcoin network, which should be a positive in the long run.",
            "Last year\u2019s deployment of the Ordinals protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain and the more recent surge in popularity of the BRC-20 token standard represents a big shift perception of the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s potential uses.",
            "Having previously been viewed as an undynamic crypto blockchain that functions purely as the ledger for a digital currency, recent innovations could push the Bitcoin blockchain towards being viewed as something more akin to a smart-contract-enabled chain.",
            "Whether this transforms Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental value proposition away from being \u201cdigital gold\u201d in the long run remains to be seen.",
            "In the short term, the transaction fee spike and associated events such as Binance\u2019s double halt of Bitcoin withdrawals over the weekend seem to have weighed on Bitcoin sentiment.",
            "BTC was last changing hands under its 50DMA in the mid-$27,000s and close to last month\u2019s lows.",
            "The loss of near-term technical momentum has some predicting that Bitcoin will retest key support in the mid-$25,000s in the coming days and weeks, assuming it also drops below support around the $26,500-$27,000 area.",
            "But upcoming macro risk events could lift sentiment and send Bitcoin back towards $30,000 \u2013 US inflation data out tomorrow and Thursday, if weaker than expected, could push crypto prices up as a result of further bets on Fed rate cuts in the second half of this year."

            "The growth rate of the number of wholecoiners only really began picking up again from June 2022, when the Bitcoin price crashed back under $30,000, before leaping in November after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX triggered a rush amongst Bitcoin investors to take self-custody of their holdings.",
            "The continued push higher in the number of 1 BTC holding wallets might thus be taken as a sign that \u201csmart money\u201d continues to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d.",
            "Indeed, while the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has performed exceptionally well so far this year (BTC was last up around 65% year-to-date), at current levels in the low-$27,000s, it still remains around 60% down versus its 2021 record highs in the $69,000 area.",
            "While a Bitcoin bull market may well be back, it's still very much in its early stages.",
            "And when the growth rate of the number of wholecoiner wallets slows/reverses, that could be a sign that the bull market is maturing."

            "That because, if the cryptocurrency maintains its current short-term momentum, it could be about to break to the north of a pennant pattern it has formed over the last few weeks.",
            "Of course, upcoming macro risks, like Friday\u2019s official US jobs report, could up-end bullish sentiment.",
            "That\u2019s because if the data is sufficiently strong, it could boost the argument for the Fed to implement further rate hikes, given the current strong labor market is complicating the Fed\u2019s battle to get inflation under wraps."

            "Analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s longer-term market cycle suggests that it would be historically normal for the cryptocurrency to remain in a strong uptrend for the foreseeable future, adding to the reasons why bulls should expect a near-term push to the north of $30,000.",
            "From the bottom of the 2015 bear market to the top of the 2017 bull market, Bitcoin gained a staggering more than 12,500%.",
            "From the bottom of its 2018 bear market to the top of its 2021 bull market, Bitcoin gained a still impressive 2,100%.",
            "Assuming diminishing returns from each bear market comeback continue, could Bitcoin perhaps be looking at a 1,000% (11x) bounce from its 2022 lows?",
            "That would imply Bitcoin reaching the $165,000 area sometime in the next few years.",
            "Elsewhere, according to the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow pricing model, the Bitcoin market cycle is roughly four years, which shows an estimated price level based on the number of BTC available in the market relative to the amount being mined each year.",
            "Bitcoin\u2019s fair price right now is around $55K and could rise above $500K in the next post-halving market cycle - that\u2019s around 20x gains from current levels.",
            "Meanwhile, Blockchaincenter.net\u2019s popular Bitcoin Rainbow Chart shows that, at current levels, Bitcoin is in the \u201cAccumulate\u201d zone, having recently recovered from the \u201cBasically a Fire Sale\u201d zone in late 2022. In other words, the model suggests that Bitcoin is gradually recovering from being highly oversold. During its last bull run, Bitcoin was able to reach the \u201cSell. Seriously, SELL!\u201d zone.\u00a0",
            "If it can repeat this feat in the next post-halving market cycle within one to one and a half years after the next halving, the model suggests a possible Bitcoin price in the $200-$300K region. That\u2019s around 7-10x gains from current levels.",
            "Assuming the BTC price does swiftly pop back to the north of the $30,000, as a trading signal tracked by Bloomberg suggested is historically likely last week, the first major resistance area for traders to watch is going to be in the $32,500-$33,000 region in the form of the late-May 2022 high and January 2022 low.",
            "The next key level above that is the February 2022 low around $34,000, then the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the 2022 lows to the 2021 record highs just under $36,000, then an old support zone in the mid-$37,000s.",
            "If Bitcoin can hurdle all of these levels, it is likely in for a swift rally above $40,000 and a test of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the 2022 lows back to the 2021 highs in the low $42,000s."

            "Crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant\u2019s \u201cEstimated Leverage Ratio\u201d (ELR) just fell to 0.195, its lowest since December 2021.",
            "That\u2019s down from a peak of 0.4 just before the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX last November, which was the catalyst for Bitcoin hitting its 2022 bear market lows in the $15,000s.",

            "When Bitcoin was at record highs in late-2021, the ELR was around current levels, before the ELR then peaked when the Bitcoin price was around the $20,000 mark.",
            "But a lower ELR could nonetheless still be bullish for the Bitcoin price, as when the market gets excessively leveraged, this can trigger volatility (as positions are stopped out).",
            "Higher volatility can deter investors. A lower volatility profile ahead could be a key factor in attracting new retail and institutional investors to the space.",
            "The drop in the ELR comes after wild liquidation-induced swings in the Bitcoin price on Wednesday.",
            "And lower volatility ahead seems to be just what investors are expecting, according to Bitcoin options market pricing.",
            "Implied volatility according to At-The-Money (ATM) Bitcoin options expiring in 7, 30, 90 and 180 days are all in the 45-55% range, which is close to historic lows.",
            "Dominant derivative exchange Deribit\u2019s Bitcoin Volatility Index (DVOL) is also near historic lows at current levels around 55.",
            "Alternative metrics of leverage in the Bitcoin market have also been in decline.",
            "The ratio of the dollar value of open interest in the Bitcoin futures market to Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization was last around 0.0176.",
            "That\u2019s according to data from The Block, which showed open interest in Bitcoin futures at around $9.7 billion on Wednesday versus Bitcoin\u2019s closing market cap of around $550 billion.",
            "On the first of November 2022, when Bitcoin\u2019s closing market cap was just over $393 billion and future open interest was around $11.56 billion, this ratio was at a much higher level of close to 0.03.",
            "The washing out of speculators and Bitcoin \u201ctourists\u201d has historically been consistent with the market finding a low and then proceeding to recover, before price momentum-related FOMO (fear of missing out) then attracts a new wave of speculators and \u201ctourists\u201d.",
            "That\u2019s why on-chain analysts like to monitor metrics such as Realized HODL Ratio, which captures the balance between BTC wealth held in 1-week old coins versus 1-2 year old coins.",
            "As can be seen in the above chart presented by crypto analytics firm Glassnode, this ratio tends to bottom in line with bear market bottoms, indicating that weaker conviction speculators and tourists have been wiped out and a higher proportion of high conviction longer-term HODLers remain."

In other words, the model suggests that Bitcoin is gradually recovering from being highly oversold. During its last bull run, Bitcoin was able to reach the \u201cSell.

            "The next key level above that is the February 2022 low around $34,000, then the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the 2022 lows to the 2021 record highs just under $36,000, then an old support zone in the mid-$37,000s.",

            "That\u2019s according to data from The Block, which showed open interest in Bitcoin futures at around $9.7 billion on Wednesday versus Bitcoin\u2019s closing market cap of around $550 billion.",
            "On the first of November 2022, when Bitcoin\u2019s closing market cap was just over $393 billion and future open interest was around $11.56 billion, this ratio was at a much higher level of close to 0.03.",
            "The washing out of speculators and Bitcoin \u201ctourists\u201d has historically been consistent with the market finding a low and then proceeding to recover, before price momentum-related FOMO (fear of missing out) then attracts a new wave of speculators and \u201ctourists\u201d.",
            "That\u2019s why on-chain analysts like to monitor metrics such as Realized HODL Ratio, which captures the balance between BTC wealth held in 1-week old coins versus 1-2 year old coins.",
            "As can be seen in the above chart presented by crypto analytics firm Glassnode, this ratio tends to bottom in line with bear market bottoms, indicating that weaker conviction speculators and tourists have been wiped out and a higher proportion of high conviction longer-term HODLers remain."

            "The drop in Bitcoin volatility expectations, as represented by the drop in DVOL, suggests that traders/investors view the recent BTC price pullback as making it more likely that the weeks ahead will see Bitcoin consolidate within recent ranges (i.e. in the $25,000-$30,000 area) rather than continue with aggressive pushes higher, as was seen in March when Bitcoin bounced rapidly from a brief dip under $20,000.",

In other words, the model suggests that Bitcoin is gradually recovering from being highly oversold. During its last bull run, Bitcoin was able to reach the \u201cSell. Seriously, SELL!\u201d zone.\u00a0",

            "Assuming the BTC price does swiftly pop back to the north of the $30,000, as a trading signal tracked by Bloomberg suggested is historically likely last week, the first major resistance area for traders to watch is going to be in the $32,500-$33,000 region in the form of the late-May 2022 high and January 2022 low.",
            "The next key level above that is the February 2022 low around $34,000, then the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the 2022 lows to the 2021 record highs just under $36,000, then an old support zone in the mid-$37,000s.",
            "If Bitcoin can hurdle all of these levels, it is likely in for a swift rally above $40,000 and a test of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the 2022 lows back to the 2021 highs in the low $42,000s."

            "The drop to fresh more than six-week lows comes despite the Bitcoin price\u2019s recent pullback from the 10-month highs it hit last week above $31,000.",
            "BTC was last changing hands in the mid-$27,000s as a barrage of key macro risk events loom in the coming two weeks.",
            "This week sees the release of the first estimate of US GDP growth in Q1 this year on Thursday and the release of the Fed\u2019s favored monthly inflation gauge (the Core PCE report) on Friday.",
            "Major US tech behemoths like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google will also be reporting earnings this week, which could also have a big impact on macro sentiment.",
            "Next week then sees the release of monthly US ISM PMI survey and jobs data, as well as a rate decision from the US central bank.",
            "The Fed is seen lifting interest rates by a further 25 bps from 4.75-5.0% to 5.0-4.25%, though money markets currently imply this will be the last rate hike of the cycle, with a rate-cutting cycle likely to begin later this year.",
            "The drop in Bitcoin volatility expectations, as represented by the drop in DVOL, suggests that traders/investors view the recent BTC price pullback as making it more likely that the weeks ahead will see Bitcoin consolidate within recent ranges (i.e. in the $25,000-$30,000 area) rather than continue with aggressive pushes higher, as was seen in March when Bitcoin bounced rapidly from a brief dip under $20,000.",
            "Alternative measures of Bitcoin volatility expectations in the form of implied volatility according to At-The-Money (ATM) option pricing are also hovering close to recent lows.\u00a0",
            "But traders shouldn\u2019t discount the risk that upcoming macro risk events can upend the market.",
            "The $27,000 and $28,000 levels are the most immediate levels for traders to keep and eye on at the start of the week, as they mark recent intra-day highs and lows, with the 50-Day Moving Average also sat at $27,120.",
            "To the downside, the $26,500 area proved a key zone of resistance-turned-support back in March and could offer decent intraday support was Bitcoin to fall back to these levels this week.",

            "With numerous\u00a0long-term on-chain indicators\u00a0flashing a buy signal for Bitcoin and with long-term market cycle analysis suggesting that the cryptocurrency is in the early stages of a bull market,\u00a0long-term focused dip-buyers\u00a0are likely to keep the BTC price supported for the foreseeable future."

            "Safe-haven demand has further boosted the BTC price amid concerns that the traditional banking sector might be in trouble in wake of a spate of US bank collapses in early March, though regulatory uncertainty amid a barrage of US SEC enforcement action has kept a lid on the upside.",
            "But as global crypto adoption continues to move in the right direction and macro/on-chain conditions shift favorably, the outlook for the BTC in the medium to long term remains strong.",

            "From the bottom of its 2018 bear market to the top of its 2021 bull market, Bitcoin gained a still impressive 2,100%.",
            "Assuming diminishing returns from each bear market comeback continue, could Bitcoin perhaps be looking at a 1,000% (11x) bounce from its 2022 lows?",
            "That would imply Bitcoin reaching the $165,000 area sometime in the next few years.",
            "Other more widely followed Bitcoin pricing models are sending a potentially more bullish story.",
            "According to the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow pricing model, the Bitcoin market cycle is roughly four years, which shows an estimated price level based on the number of BTC available in the market relative to the amount being mined each year.",
            "Bitcoin\u2019s fair price right now is around $55K and could rise above $500K in the next post-halving market cycle - that\u2019s around 20x gains from current levels.",
            "Finally, Blockchaincenter.net\u2019s popular Bitcoin Rainbow Chart shows that, at current levels, Bitcoin is in the \u201cAccumulate\u201d zone, having recently recovered from the \u201cBasically a Fire Sale\u201d zone in late 2022. In other words, the model suggests that Bitcoin is gradually recovering from being highly oversold. During its last bull run, Bitcoin was able to reach the \u201cSell. Seriously, SELL!\u201d zone.\u00a0",

            "That implies that macro is unlikely to return as a major headwind to crypto markets in 2023, as was the case in 2022.",

            "As such, expect bargain hunters and dip-buyers to be waiting eagerly on the sidelines to jump in each time Bitcoin posts significant price dips, just as was the case during mid-March.",
            "A drop back to the $25,000s could mark such an opportunity for the longer-term bulls,\u00a0and would mark a near-20% drop from earlier monthly highs above $31,000.",

            "As of Monday the 17th of April, the price, if the MVRV Ratio was 2.4, would be around $47,700 and at 3.2 would be around $63.600.",
            "If Bitcoin\u2019s price was at these levels, then it would be fair to say that the market is currently very hot.",

            "If we are in a new Bitcoin bull market, the Realized Price is almost certain to see a sustained rise in the coming quarters and years and that will push the 2.4 and 3.2 MVRV Ratio bands higher as well.",
            "How much higher? No one can know for sure.",
            "But let\u2019s say it's 3x higher versus current levels, like during the most recent bull market.",

            "The 3.2 MVRV Ratio band, meanwhile, would rise to around $190,000.",
            "That suggests that we might feasibly be able to see Bitcoin\u2019s price rally into the upper $100,000s in the coming years before we start labeling the rally as getting dangerously hot."

            "If it can repeat this feat in the next post-halving market cycle within one to one and a half years after the next halving, the model suggests a possible Bitcoin price in the $200-$300K region. That\u2019s around 7-10x gains from current levels."

            "Indeed, while still down around 4.5% versus the 10-month highs it hit earlier this month above $31,000, Bitcoin has now rebounded close to 10% since testing its 50-Day Moving Average in the $27,000 area a few days ago.",
            "And with bank crisis concerns back in focus as First Republic comes under scrutiny once again (creating safe-haven demand for Bitcoin) and tech stocks surging (with which Bitcoin is positively correlated), bulls are preparing for a price blowout to the north of the psychologically important $30,000 level.",
            "And macro fundamentals aren\u2019t Bitcoin\u2019s only tailwind right now.",
            "The cryptocurrency continues to benefit from technical buying as a result of 1) the strong rebound from the 50DMA, 2) the strong rebound from the 200DMA and realized price back in March under $20,000 and 3) the \u201cgolden cross\u201d in early February.",
            "A number of analysts noted on Twitter that Bitcoin appears to be following in the steps of a rally it saw in 2019 where the cryptocurrency posed lows that kept curving higher.",
            "One analyst asked whether we are about to see an \u201cimpulsive\u201d rally in Bitcoin towards $50,000.",
            "Analysis of Bitcoin\u2019s longer-term market cycle suggests that it would be historically normal for the cryptocurrency to remain in a strong uptrend for the foreseeable future, adding to the reasons why bulls should expect a near-term push to the north of $30,000.",
            "From the bottom of the 2015 bear market to the top of the 2017 bull market, Bitcoin gained a staggering more than 12,500%.",
            "From the bottom of its 2018 bear market to the top of its 2021 bull market, Bitcoin gained a still impressive 2,100%.",
            "Assuming diminishing returns from each bear market comeback continue, could Bitcoin perhaps be looking at a 1,000% (11x) bounce from its 2022 lows?",
            "That would imply Bitcoin reaching the $165,000 area sometime in the next few years.",
            "Elsewhere, according to the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow pricing model, the Bitcoin market cycle is roughly four years, which shows an estimated price level based on the number of BTC available in the market relative to the amount being mined each year.",
            "Bitcoin\u2019s fair price right now is around $55K and could rise above $500K in the next post-halving market cycle - that\u2019s around 20x gains from current levels.",
            "Meanwhile, Blockchaincenter.net\u2019s popular Bitcoin Rainbow Chart shows that, at current levels, Bitcoin is in the \u201cAccumulate\u201d zone, having recently recovered from the \u201cBasically a Fire Sale\u201d zone in late 2022. In other words, the model suggests that Bitcoin is gradually recovering from being highly oversold. During its last bull run, Bitcoin was able to reach the \u201cSell. Seriously, SELL!\u201d zone.\u00a0",
            "If it can repeat this feat in the next post-halving market cycle within one to one and a half years after the next halving, the model suggests a possible Bitcoin price in the $200-$300K region. That\u2019s around 7-10x gains from current levels.",
            "Assuming the BTC price does swiftly pop back to the north of the $30,000, as a trading signal tracked by Bloomberg suggested is historically likely last week, the first major resistance area for traders to watch is going to be in the $32,500-$33,000 region in the form of the late-May 2022 high and January 2022 low.",
            "The next key level above that is the February 2022 low around $34,000, then the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the 2022 lows to the 2021 record highs just under $36,000, then an old support zone in the mid-$37,000s.",
            "If Bitcoin can hurdle all of these levels, it is likely in for a swift rally above $40,000 and a test of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the 2022 lows back to the 2021 highs in the low $42,000s."

            "A measure of leverage in the Bitcoin market just fell to its lowest since late 2021, a sign that volatility inducing speculators are increasingly being washed out of the market, meaning that the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization may be in for calmer waters ahead.",
            "Crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant\u2019s \u201cEstimated Leverage Ratio\u201d (ELR) just fell to 0.195, its lowest since December 2021.",
            "That\u2019s down from a peak of 0.4 just before the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX last November, which was the catalyst for Bitcoin hitting its 2022 bear market lows in the $15,000s.",
            "CryptoQuant calculates its ELR by dividing the dollar value of open perpetual Bitcoin future contract positions by the number of Bitcoin tokens being held by derivatives exchanges (where traders open those perpetual Bitcoin future positions).",
            "A lower number means that traders on derivatives exchanges are opening less leveraged positions proportional to the number of tokens they have on the exchange, essentially implying there is less speculation in the market.",
            "As can be seen above, the relationship between CryptoQuant\u2019s ELR and the BTC price is weak.",
            "When Bitcoin was at record highs in late-2021, the ELR was around current levels, before the ELR then peaked when the Bitcoin price was around the $20,000 mark.",
            "But a lower ELR could nonetheless still be bullish for the Bitcoin price, as when the market gets excessively leveraged, this can trigger volatility (as positions are stopped out).",
            "Higher volatility can deter investors. A lower volatility profile ahead could be a key factor in attracting new retail and institutional investors to the space.",
            "The drop in the ELR comes after wild liquidation-induced swings in the Bitcoin price on Wednesday.",
            "And lower volatility ahead seems to be just what investors are expecting, according to Bitcoin options market pricing.",
            "Implied volatility according to At-The-Money (ATM) Bitcoin options expiring in 7, 30, 90 and 180 days are all in the 45-55% range, which is close to historic lows.",
            "Dominant derivative exchange Deribit\u2019s Bitcoin Volatility Index (DVOL) is also near historic lows at current levels around 55.",
            "Alternative metrics of leverage in the Bitcoin market have also been in decline.",
            "The ratio of the dollar value of open interest in the Bitcoin futures market to Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization was last around 0.0176.",
            "That\u2019s according to data from The Block, which showed open interest in Bitcoin futures at around $9.7 billion on Wednesday versus Bitcoin\u2019s closing market cap of around $550 billion.",
            "On the first of November 2022, when Bitcoin\u2019s closing market cap was just over $393 billion and future open interest was around $11.56 billion, this ratio was at a much higher level of close to 0.03.",
            "The washing out of speculators and Bitcoin \u201ctourists\u201d has historically been consistent with the market finding a low and then proceeding to recover, before price momentum-related FOMO (fear of missing out) then attracts a new wave of speculators and \u201ctourists\u201d.",
            "That\u2019s why on-chain analysts like to monitor metrics such as Realized HODL Ratio, which captures the balance between BTC wealth held in 1-week old coins versus 1-2 year old coins.",
            "As can be seen in the above chart presented by crypto analytics firm Glassnode, this ratio tends to bottom in line with bear market bottoms, indicating that weaker conviction speculators and tourists have been wiped out and a higher proportion of high conviction longer-term HODLers remain."
